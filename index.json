I’ve spent an insane amount of time on social media, watching YouTube videos, shorts, scrolling endlessly on Twitter and the list goes on and on.\nMaybe I was happy from the experience of participating on social media and playing videos. I enjoyed doing these things.\nThe curse of social media # For me, time spent on social media helped me discover or learn something new, but for the most part, it ended up in rage filled walls of text to an anonymous somebody who had a different world view than I did.\nThis was everywhere - Reddit, Twitter, Facebook.. you name it. And this was not just me - go check out any comments section and you will find arguments, abuse, ranting and trolling and what not.\nThe comments section on social media is like a knife. You can cut or you can get cut. When I received likes and upvotes from people in the community for a comment I made, I felt elated and happy.. I was in charge of the cutting. It felt like I’ve achieved something with this one-up I gained over an anonymous bumpkin who thought he knew better.\nI would also receive downvotes and dislikes for a comment that didn’t toe the vibe line of the community, and that would disappoint me. Even though discussions were anonymous, I wanted to be heard and appreciated.. I didn’t pursue this actively, but these are goals that every internet user like me has. There’s something about public validation, from people I didn’t even know, that would make me happy.\nComputers and the Digital Life is in my Blood # I’m no newbie to the world of computers and the digital dimension. I’ve been playing video games since I was 10 from when I got the NES as a gift. And I learnt Linux bash programming by the time I was 15.\nBut what really mesmerised me was video games on a computer! Once I started playing games on a PC, it was the only thing I ever cared about.\nAs I got older, I got more into gaming and even pursued it as a career option during college.\nFast forward to until recently, I still was playing video games, although not the competitive ones I used to play back then, but I did spend a significant time during the weekdays and weekends playing video games.\nVideo games were my escape into virtual worlds and alternate realities. They were the gateway to free my mind from real life. And I spent countless hours on video games.. For instance, I spent over 2000 hours on one game alone. From hour 1 to hour 2000, I got better at the game. But once I shut down my PC, I’m back to my normal world - and what had changed for me personally during the time I spent gaming? Nothing.\nEnter Enlightenment # Then one night, as I was lying down on my bed, it hit me.\nWhat was the point of those numerous hours on Dota, Counter Strike and all those MMORPGs I’ve played over the years?\nWhat was the point of responding to comments on Reddit? I think I’ve spent many hours on social media platforms because of comments I simply had the urge to respond to. Why was I loving this debate?\nMy subconscious decided it was time to float these questions. And I’m glad it did.. better now than never I thought.\nThe answer also came to me - it was time to shut things off that were adding no value to my life.\nI decided to become more self-aware about where I was spending my time to ensure I utilise my time in the best way possible; which is to achieve my goals.\nWhat would I need to do to make this happen? Quit cold Turkey. Nothing else would do.\nMy introduction to Digital Minimalism # The next day, during lunch, I was on YouTube.. because I like to watch something while eating.. and I found a video on “digital minimalism.”\nGoogle was now listening to my thoughts!?\nAnyway, I watched this video by Cal Newport, who is also the author of the book “Digital Minimalism,” and the video was a summary of the book.\nAnd basically, what I wanted to do via self-discipline and self-awareness was now being put into a framework by the author. Until now, I had no phrase for what I was feeling, but now it had a name - digital minimalism. This was my introduction to this concept.\nWhat is digital minimalism? # According to Cal Newport, the idea of digital minimalism is not about abandoning all technology and the internet and going to live in a cave. It is about how to utilise the technology we have in a way that helps us achieve our goals.\nAnother important aspect is to be aware of whether a piece of technology or subscription is really essential to our life or if we’re getting it because of FOMO.\nThis video taught me to ask these types of questions - “Do I really need that new phone because it looks cool and packs in the latest technology and I want to be known as someone who is using the latest tech?” VERSUS “How is this latest technology on this new phone going to help me achieve my goal x or goal y?”\nMy new plan to use technology # A sentence Cal Newport used on his video that stuck with me was, “You have to be comfortable missing out on everything else.”\nThis sentence was more a mindset than a commandment - something that I could resonate with deeply.\nThe good news, I thought, was I never really binged on apps like Instagram watching posts or stories endlessly - I don’t even use it. I never had the urge to “share” everything I was doing in my life. I was more intellectually involved in the comments section on Reddit or Twitter - this is where bulk of my time was being spent.\nNot getting influenced # My new plan is going to be to simple - to not get swayed or influenced by anything and everything on social media or the gaming world. Especially the comments, the drama, the news, the mega sales and stuff that doesn’t add any value to my life.\nIf I didn’t like something, I would just move on.\nIt’s not about living like a monk and abandoning everything .. because that would be silly for me as a digital marketer. In this profession I had to be at the cutting edge of everything digital, tech and internet politics so I needed to find a good balance.\nDeveloping self awareness # My plan was to develop self-awareness on how I was putting technology to use to help achieve my goals - like writing something unique once a week or learning digital marketing. If I am doing something that is not adding to my goals, it was not worth wasting time on it.\nMore importantly, I wouldn’t be buying games and electronics because they’re on a sale and I don’t want to miss out. I’d also be saving money by not upgrading to a phone simply because it is the latest out there. I’d only be buying something unless it is absolutely necessary.\nHow digital minimalism is working out so far # Fast forward to today, I sometimes have a deep urge to reply to comments and I start typing. But after having typed a paragraph, I become aware of what I’m doing.. I smile and click discard. I’ve never been more happy. I don’t have the urge to tell someone what I think anymore - I just don’t care enough to waste my time.\nI know that my attention is the currency for companies like Instagram, Facebook, Reddit and YouTube to make money. So instead of letting these companies take charge of my attention, I’m going to take back control. And that’s my plan.\nHave you felt like this? What do you think about digital minimalism?\n","date":"14 June 2023","permalink":"/blog/digital-minimalism/","section":"Blogs","summary":"I’ve never been more happy.

It was introduced by Elias St. Elmo Lewis in 1898 and has been used to create effective content that captures the attention of potential customers, generates interest in a product or service, builds desire, and ultimately leads them to take action.\nThe AIDA model is applicable to various types of communication, including print ads, radio spots, television commercials, and digital marketing. To implement the AIDA model in your marketing efforts, follow these steps:\nAttention: Grab the attention of your target audience with a catchy headline or a compelling image. Make sure it is relevant to the product or service you are promoting. Interest: Once you have your audience\u0026rsquo;s attention, pique their interest with interesting facts, features, or benefits of your product or service. This should encourage them to research further and become more engaged with your offering. Desire: Make your audience desire your product or service by showcasing its unique selling points, value propositions, and testimonials from satisfied customers. Create an emotional connection with your audience by highlighting how your product or service can solve their problems or improve their lives. Action: Finally, guide your audience towards taking a specific action, such as purchasing your product, signing up for a newsletter, or contacting your sales team. Make it easy for them to take the desired action by providing clear instructions and calls-to-action. To effectively use the AIDA model in your marketing strategy, it\u0026rsquo;s essential to understand your target audience and tailor your content to their needs, preferences, and pain points.\nAdditionally, you can apply the AIDA model to various marketing channels, such as email marketing, blog posts, social media, and website content.\nHowever, it\u0026rsquo;s important to note that the AIDA model doesn\u0026rsquo;t take into account non-linear buyer\u0026rsquo;s journeys and may not cover all aspects of the customer experience, such as customer lifetime value and satisfaction.\nDespite these limitations, the AIDA model remains a valuable framework for guiding your marketing and advertising efforts.\nExamples of the AIDA model in action # One example of a brand that has successfully used the AIDA framework is Netflix. Netflix has created advertisements that grab customers\u0026rsquo; attention with their bold and quirky designs and compelling headlines. A Netflix AD They then generate interest by showcasing the unique features of their service, such as their vast library of content and personalized recommendations. Next, they create desire by highlighting the benefits of their service, such as the convenience of watching shows on any device and the ability to watch entire seasons at once. Finally, they encourage action by providing a clear call to action, such as signing up for a free trial. Using Interest, Desire and Action Another example of a brand that has successfully used the AIDA framework is Mini Cooper. Mini Cooper used a quirky guerrilla marketing strategy of placing giant cardboard cartons with torn gift wrapping on the streets of Amsterdam after Christmas to attract attention and generate interest. They then created desire by showcasing the unique features of their cars, such as their compact size and stylish design. Finally, they encouraged action by providing a clear call to action, such as scheduling a test drive. Mini Cooper\u0026rsquo;s Christmas Campaign ADs What to measure - KPIs # Attention: At this stage, the goal is to increase brand awareness and attract the target audience\u0026rsquo;s attention. Metrics to track include impressions, reach, and click-through rates (CTR) for digital ads, social media posts, or content marketing efforts.\nInterest: Once the attention is captured, the focus shifts to generating interest in the product or service by showcasing its benefits. Metrics to track include average time spent on website pages, content engagement rates (likes, shares, comments), and email open rates.\nDesire: At this stage, the aim is to evoke desire in the potential customer by proving the need for the product or service. Metrics to track include conversion rates from interest to desire (e.g., number of users who add a product to their wishlist or cart) and engagement with content that showcases product benefits or features.\nAction: The final stage involves prompting the user to take action, such as making a purchase or signing up for a service. Metrics to track include conversion rates from desire to action (e.g., completed purchases, sign-ups, or form submissions), cost per acquisition (CPA), and return on ad spend (ROAS).\nThe AIDA model works everywhere # The AIDA model can be used for literally any marketing content since all marketing content is focused on taking users or potential customers on a journey, the AIDA model can be applied for advertising on print or online, email marketing, blogs, landing page content, and more.\nConsider this fictional scenario: A customer is unhappy with how the car company (let\u0026rsquo;s call it X) authorized service center serviced his car. The customer\u0026rsquo;s questions were also not answered properly making the entire experience sour for the customer. The customer is so unhappy that he is now telling his friends and family not to buy cars made by X because of their pathetic service.\nHere\u0026rsquo;s an email (using AIDA) from a customer service representative at X cars who is trying to turn this unhappy customer.\nSubject: Our Commitment to Your Satisfaction - Let Us Make It Right\nDear [Customer\u0026rsquo;s Name],\nI hope this email finds you well.

They may not even know there are tools like automatic invoice readers and processing systems that are faster and accurate that will enable them to focus on other activities and automate these fatigue-inducing manual activities like invoice processing.\nSo the accounts payable professional has not actually recognized a problem exists because they are conditioned to think this is how it works, and maybe even the higher ups haven’t either. So, what we have here is a huge gap _to _the awareness stage. In other words, the Earth’s orbit hasn’t yet attracted a passing Meteor.\nSo, could there be another step above awareness?\nIn this blog post, I’d like to share the concept of a stage before awareness called the Discovery stage, and by understanding the significance of this additional step, it’ll possibly help us better capture our potential customer’s attention, help them discover they have a problem, and ultimately guide them into the awareness phase of the marketing funnel.\nWhat is the discovery stage? # Picture this- we know our toothpaste is running out, and so we know what toothpaste to buy - we’re conditioned to use a toothpaste by our family and society in general - there’s no way we’d have skipped knowing this growing up. We know what we want our toothpaste to do generally, and what taste we want in our toothpaste, so we just skipped the awareness, consideration stages and went straight to the purchase stage to buy the product we know we want.\nHowever, in the case of the accounts payable professional I wrote about above, there was a huge gap to the awareness stage because he/she doesn\u0026rsquo;t even know a problem exists.\nIf we\u0026rsquo;re a business selling automated invoice processing software, wouldn\u0026rsquo;t we want to make them aware that the accounts payable function too many manual processes that slows it down?.. And that’s where the discovery stage comes in.\nLet’s think of this as the initial touchpoint between our business and our potential customers. In a crowded marketplace, capturing attention and standing out from competitors is critical - I mean there are thousands of companies selling automation software.\nSo by introducing the Discovery stage, we can help our potential prospects discover a problem exists, create impactful first impressions, generate that initial interest, and expand our reach to individuals who may not have been actively seeking our products or services.\nDuring this stage, we\u0026rsquo;re also creating brand awareness and establishing a connection with our target audience by introducing ourselves, our mission, our values, and our unique selling points to potential customers like the accounts payable professional of this example.\nAnd by doing so, we’re sowing the seeds of interest and laying the foundations for further engagement.\nHow is this discovery stage different from the awareness stage? # Now, there may be some overlap, but these are different stages and that is why I think they are also unique in what they do.\nThe Awareness stage targets individuals who have realized a problem exists and are looking for solutions on how to solve it. And so they are also receptive to specific messaging that revolves around their problem - this is where SEO comes in. Typical content marketing addresses the problem and showcases how to solve them with an intent to provide value to readers.\nThe awareness stage also focuses on utilizing channels where prospects are actively seeking solutions to their problems. SEO-optimized content, ADs on search engines, and even ABM.\nHowever, the Discovery stage must target a broader audience, including individuals who may not have actively sought out solutions or identified a problem. It aims to reach and engage with potential customers who are not yet aware of their needs. So the content here should focus on creating curiosity, capturing attention, and generating interest. Since this is not laser targeted yet, it may make sense to talk about broader industry challenges or pain points rather than specific product or service offerings.\nWe aim to reach a wider audience with the discovery stage and thus tactics like social media marketing (paid), influencer collaborations, writing content on other publications, and PR activities make sense. The goal is to cast a wide net and generate initial brand awareness - does this remind you of TV advertising? This is actually something like that since the funnel stage is broader than awareness.\nWhen does using the discovery stage make sense? # Let\u0026rsquo;s talk about your business. Determining when it makes sense to invest in marketing for the Discovery stage depends on various factors, including the nature of the industry, target audience characteristics, and business goals.\nHere are some examples that illustrate situations where investing in the Discovery stage makes sense and hopefully you’ll be able to relate with one of these scenarios.\nIntroduction of a New Product or Service: If you’re launching a new product or service that offers a unique solution, investing in the Discovery stage can help create awareness among potential customers who may not yet be aware of the problem your offering solves - plain and simple. For example: a company developing a revolutionary home automation system may invest in Discovery stage marketing to educate homeowners about the convenience and energy-saving benefits of home automation. How would they do it? We’ll get to that in the next section. Emerging Trends or Industry Shifts: When an industry undergoes significant changes or experiences emerging trends, like the stuff we’re seeing around AI, investing in the Discovery stage can help you position yourselves as thought leaders and create awareness around new challenges or opportunities. For example: a company specializing in data analysis or statistics can talk about how they leverage blockchain technology to improve analysis. They could invest in Discovery stage marketing to educate businesses about the potential hazards of incorrect data and where blockchain comes in. Targeting Niche or Underserved Markets: If you’re operating in a niche market or you think you’re serving an underserved audience, investing in the Discovery stage can help reach potential customers who may not actively seek out solutions but could benefit from its product or service. For example: a company offering eco-friendly packaging alternatives may invest in Discovery stage marketing to raise awareness among businesses like Swiggy and Zomato, of the environmental impact of traditional packaging materials. This would also trickle down to restaurants who offer food delivery in plastic packaging. Shifting Customer Preferences or Behaviors: When customer preferences or behaviors change, investing in the Discovery stage can allow you to adapt and capture the attention of potential customers who may not realize the need for a different approach or solution. For example: During Covid-19, a lot of companies started advertising about mental health and wellness - a response to a shift in consumer behavior and attitude in general during the Covid-19 pandemic. First movers gained a lot of attention during this time. Brand Differentiation and Unique Selling Proposition: If you want to differentiate yourselves from competitors and highlight your unique selling proposition, investing in the Discovery stage can help create awareness of the distinct value it offers to potential customers. This is possibly the least precise reason I have to invest in this, but it is still a good strategy because you get a chance to make a great first impression. For example: a software company that sells a no-code platform that is trying to sell ease of creating apps, can invest in Discovery stage marketing to highlight how it is easy for anyone to bring their ideas to life. These are but a few examples to demonstrate scenarios where investing in the Discovery stage can be beneficial to create awareness, educate potential customers, and position a business as a solution provider.\nIt\u0026rsquo;s essential to analyze your specific business goals, target audience, and industry dynamics to determine when investing in the Discovery stage aligns with your marketing strategy and objectives.\nStrategies for the discovery stage # Social Media Awareness Campaigns: Utilize social media platforms to raise awareness about common industry challenges or pain points. Develop engaging and shareable content, such as informative videos, eye-catching visuals, or thought-provoking questions, to capture the attention of your target audience. By targeting specific demographics or interests, you can reach potential customers who may not be actively searching for solutions. Influencer Marketing: Collaborate with influencers in your industry who have a large following and credibility. Influencers can create content, such as videos, blog posts, or social media endorsements, that highlight the problems your product or service addresses. Their influence can help expose your brand and solution to a wider audience who may not have been actively searching for it. This is probably the biggest discovery tactic that I have seen companies use. I can’t tell you how many new companies I have been introduced to by Linus Tech Tips and other tech channels on YouTube. Thought Leadership Content: Develop thought leadership content that addresses industry challenges and presents unique perspectives or insights. This can be in the form of articles, whitepapers, or opinion pieces. By showcasing your expertise and providing valuable information, you can capture the attention of potential customers who may not be aware of their problems yet. But you can’t just post them on your website, you will have to find websites that talk about the topics you’re interested in, and give it to them so you can reach these new audiences. Education and Awareness Events: Host webinars, workshops, or seminars that educate your target audience about industry trends, best practices, or emerging challenges. Positioning these events as opportunities for learning, professional development and networking works very well. Attendees gain new knowledge and become aware of problems they hadn\u0026rsquo;t considered before. PR and Media Outreach: Engage in public relations activities to secure media coverage or guest appearances on relevant podcasts or radio shows. Position yourself or your brand as an expert in your industry and use these platforms to raise awareness about industry challenges. This can help reach a wider audience, including those who may not be actively searching online. This may be expensive, and if you have the budget, this is also an amazing way to see traction. Networking and Industry Events: Attend industry conferences, trade shows, or networking events to connect with potential customers face-to-face. Engage in conversations, share insights, and listen to industry pain points. This direct interaction can help you identify individuals who may not be aware of their problems and allow you to introduce your solution. This is probably the best way to collect intelligence, and also the best way to plant a seed in your prospects’ heads. Use this in the smartest way possible. Surveys and Quizzes: A survey blast is not typically done anymore, but I think if you have interested participants who are your potential customers, asking them questions and making them answer about it willingly, is sometimes the fastest way to close a lead. These surveys can be marketed as ads on websites, and social media. G2 or Capterra send me emails asking me to review something for a chance to win a $100 voucher - and I have written reviews for software I use. (I never won, which is another conversation.) But you can use something like this to entice your potential customers to participate. If you’re not going to give anything, don’t expect them to give them your time. The AIDA model would serve as a fantastic way to craft content for the discovery stage.\nMoving from Discovery to Awareness # The primary objective of the Discovery stage is to transition potential customers from a state of unawareness to active awareness. To accomplish this, you must strategically guide individuals towards the next phase of the marketing funnel.\nYou may already be doing this in the awareness stage with compelling CTAs, lead magnets and so on - it is the same here. Basically, you’re telling them what the next step is and skillfully guiding them there.\nMeasuring Success # As with any marketing strategy, it\u0026rsquo;s crucial to measure the effectiveness of the Discovery stage and make iterative improvements.\nSince the spray is wide, what metrics do we measure? Here are what I think could be key metrics:\nReach and Impressions: Monitor the reach and impressions of your Discovery stage content to understand how many people are exposed to your brand. This will help gauge the effectiveness of your strategies and identify opportunities for improvement. Engagement Metrics: Measure metrics like click-through rates, video views, social media likes, comments, and shares to assess the level of engagement your content generates. This will provide insights into the resonance of your messaging and the effectiveness of your creative elements. Comments sometimes can reveal interesting stuff that was never thought of before - make sure to track and read them. Conversion Rate: Track the conversion rate from the Discovery stage to the awareness stage by monitoring the number of users who take desired actions, such as subscribing, downloading resources, or following your brand. This will help evaluate the success of your efforts in transitioning potential customers to the next stage. Based on the insights gained from these metrics, you can refine your Discovery stage strategy. This is all about how creative you can get so experiment with different content formats, platforms, messaging, and targeting techniques to optimize results and move your leads to the next stage.\nMeasuring the success of the Discovery stage is crucial for iterative improvements. Monitoring reach, engagement metrics, conversion rates, and gathering qualitative feedback can help refine strategy and tactics further.\nWhile this may sound counter intuitive in the age of inbound marketing, I think there is way too much organic digital noise. Ranking high on SEO is a long term game and until you race to the never approaching finish line, using strategy and tactics for the Discovery stage will allow you to proactively engage with your target audience, establish brand awareness, and create a solid foundation for further interactions.\nTell me what you think # Let me know what you think of the discovery stage as an initial touchpoint. Can we as marketers actually build stronger relationships because we helped a customer discover a problem? Or will it be because we’re providing something of value after they’ve discovered a problem?\n","date":"20 May 2023","permalink":"/blog/marketing-funnel/","section":"Blogs","summary":"By introducing the Discovery stage, we can help our potential prospects discover a problem exists, create impactful first impressions, generate that initial interest, and expand our reach to individuals who may not have been actively seeking our products or services.","title":"Reimagining the Marketing Funnel with the Discovery Stage"},{"content":"","date":"5 May 2023","permalink":"/tags/jamstack/","section":"Tags","summary":"","title":"JAMStack"},{"content":"","date":"5 May 2023","permalink":"/tags/website/","section":"Tags","summary":"","title":"website"},{"content":"The concept of JAMStack has been around for several years, but the term itself was first coined in 2016 by Mathias Biilmann, CEO and co-founder of Netlify, a popular JAMStack platform. Since then, JAMStack has gained significant popularity and has become a preferred approach for building modern web applications and websites and Netlify has been at the forefront of this adoption.\nWhat is the JAMStack? # JAMStack is an acronym that stands for JavaScript, APIs, and Markup. It is a modern architecture for building websites and web applications that relies on pre-built markup, client-side JavaScript, and serverless functions. JAMStack is different from traditional web development approaches because it separates the front-end and back-end layers of a web application.\nTraditional web development involves building a monolithic application that relies on a server to generate HTML dynamically. This approach has several drawbacks, including slower page load times, increased security risks, and limited scalability. JAMStack, on the other hand, uses pre-built markup that is served statically from a content delivery network (CDN). This means that pages load faster and are more secure, as there is no server-side code to attack.\nIn simpler words, on a LAMP stack system like Wordpress, when a user requests for a web page, the server generates the HTML content dynamically based on the user’s request and sends it back to the user’s browser. Whereas in the JAMStack, the pages are already in HTML and are immediately delivered via a CDN.\nStatic websites are not new - The principles underlying JAMStack have been in use for many years. In fact, static site generators have been around for over a decade, and CDNs have been used to cache and distribute web content since the early days of the internet.\nWhat JAMStack has done is bring together these existing technologies and best practices into a coherent approach for building modern web applications. By leveraging the power of JavaScript, APIs, and pre-built markup, this approach provides a faster, more secure, and more flexible way of building web applications.\nThe rise and rise of JAMStack # The rise of JAMStack can be attributed to several factors, including the increasing popularity of JavaScript frameworks like React and Vue.js, the growing use of APIs for back-end functionality, and the desire for faster, more secure, and more flexible web applications. JAMStack has also been embraced by the developer community, who appreciate its simplicity, ease of use, and ability to integrate with modern development tools and workflows.\nJAMStack has gained significant popularity in recent years as a preferred approach for building modern web applications, and its rise can be attributed to several factors, including the increasing popularity of JavaScript frameworks and APIs, as well as the desire for faster, more secure, and more flexible web applications.\nAccording to the HTTPArchive almanac, JAMStack websites have been growing considerably since 2020 - and in this article I will try to outline some of the concepts of JAMStack and by the end, you will understand the reason for this growth.\nMore importantly, we will also look at how it works, what are its benefits, and why digital marketers should care about it.\nHow does the JAMStack work? # JAMStack is built on three main components: static site generators, client-side JavaScript frameworks, and serverless functions.\nStatic site generators are tools that generate static HTML, CSS, and JavaScript files based on templates and content. These files are then uploaded to a Content Delivery Network (CDN), where they are served to the end-user. Popular static site generators include Jekyll, Gatsby, and Hugo - this website uses Hugo.\nClient-side JavaScript frameworks, such as React, Vue.js, and Angular, are used to add interactivity to the static HTML files. These frameworks allow developers to create complex user interfaces and handle user interactions on the client-side, without relying on a server to handle the logic.\nServerless functions, such as AWS Lambda and Google Cloud Functions, are used to handle server-side functionality, such as form submissions and database queries. These functions are triggered by API calls and are executed in response to specific events.\nA typical JAMStack website can use various API services to enhance its functionality and improve user experience. Some typical APIs are Payment processing APIs like Stripe or Paypal, CRM APIs like Hubspot or Salesforce, Marketing automation APIs like Pardot or Marketo, and so on. In short, anything that can be used as an API can be put on a JAMStack website making it extremely easy to operate.\nWhy should digital marketers care about JAMStack? # Before we get into the what, we need to know the why. And the following insights are excellent for that.\nAkamai Technologies found that when their client’s site loaded in 4.2 seconds, the average conversion rate dropped below 1% from an average of 1.9%: This metric comes from Akamai Technologies\u0026rsquo; State of Online Retail Performance report from 2017. The report found that a 100-millisecond delay in website load time can lead to a 7% decrease in conversion rates, and a 2-second delay can result in a 103% increase in bounce rate. The 4.2-second load time mentioned in this metric is above the industry standard of 2 seconds or less. Akamai Technologies did another study where they found pages that loaded in 2.7 seconds had a bounce rate of 12.8%, while pages that loaded in 4 seconds had a bounce rate of 25%. Google found that 53% of mobile users will leave a website that takes longer than three seconds to load: This metric comes from a Google study from 2018, which found that mobile users expect sites to load in 3 seconds or less, and that 53% of mobile site visits are abandoned if pages take longer than 3 seconds to load. Forrester Research found that 47 percent of consumers expect a web page to load in two seconds or less: This metric comes from a Forrester Research study from 2009. While it is an older study, it highlights the importance of fast page load times for user experience and conversion rates. Kissmetrics found that a 1-second delay in page load time can lead to an 11% reduction in page views, a 16% reduction in customer satisfaction, and a 7% reduction in conversions: This metric comes from a Kissmetrics blog post from 2011, which analyzed the impact of page load time on user behavior and conversion rates. Unbounce found that a delay of even 100 milliseconds in page load time can result in a 7% reduction in conversions as well: This metric comes from a 2019 Unbounce blog post that examined the impact of page load time on conversion rates for landing pages. Amazon found that a 100-millisecond delay in page load time could result in a 1% loss in sales: This metric comes from a 2006 Amazon study, which found that a 100-millisecond increase in page load time resulted in a 1% decrease in sales. A study by Skilled found that slow loading pages resulted in a 25% decrease in engagement and a 60% decrease in page views. According to research by Radware, a 2-second delay in page load time can result in a 51% decrease in website performance and a 50% decrease in user satisfaction. According to a study done by CSSTricks, JAMStack was proven to be extremely fast in comparison to CMS and the current web average FCP (First Contentful Paint) and TTI (Time to Interactive.)\nSee the full study here: A Look at JAMstack’s Speed, By the Numbers\nSo, the above statistics are proving why we need a faster and a modern system to serve content and we also have data to prove how JAMStack is fast. With this as the premise, let\u0026rsquo;s get a high-level picture of how JAMStack offers several benefits for digital marketers:\nFaster page load times: One of the primary benefits of JAMStack is that it can significantly improve page load times. Since JAMStack sites are static, they can be pre-built and served from a CDN. This means that when a user requests a page, it can be served from a nearby CDN edge server, resulting in faster load times. Fast load times are an important ranking factor for search engines, and can also improve user experience, leading to higher engagement and lower bounce rates. Improved conversion rates: JAMStack sites can improve conversion rates by providing a better user experience. By leveraging modern web technologies like dynamic form submission and real-time updates, JAMStack sites can provide a more engaging and interactive experience for users, leading to higher conversion rates. Additionally, JAMStack sites tend to have faster load times, which can reduce bounce rates and improve engagement, leading to higher conversion rates. Better content management: JAMStack sites are ideal for content-driven websites, like blogs and news sites. With JAMStack, content can be managed using modern content management systems like Contentful and Netlify CMS. This allows marketers to easily manage and publish content, without the need for complex server-side rendering or database management. Additionally, JAMStack sites can be easily integrated with third-party marketing tools like email marketing software and social media platforms, making it easier to promote content and drive traffic to the website. Better site architecture: JAMStack sites tend to have better site architecture, which can improve search engine crawlability and indexing. Since JAMStack sites are static and do not rely on dynamic server-side rendering, they tend to have simpler and more predictable site architecture. This makes it easier for search engines to crawl and index pages, resulting in better search engine visibility. Flexibility: JAMStack is a flexible architecture that allows digital marketers to create complex web applications quickly and easily. Because JAMStack separates the front-end and back-end layers of a web application, developers can use the best tools for each layer. This means that digital marketers can create web applications that are more efficient, easier to maintain, and more scalable. This is especially useful for building link baits depending on your industry. Improved user experience: JAMStack sites can provide an improved user experience by leveraging modern web technologies like serverless functions and APIs. By using these technologies, JAMStack sites can provide a more dynamic and interactive user experience, without sacrificing performance or security. Examples of JAMStack websites # There are many examples of JAMStack websites that showcase the power and flexibility of this modern web development architecture. These are some popular ones I know of:\nSmashing Magazine: Smashing Magazine is a popular website for web designers and developers.

Brian Dean used Netlify\u0026rsquo;s professional services to help him migrate the site. Read here. Celonis: Celonis is a process mining product company that addresses how to improve business processes. Here\u0026rsquo;s Celonis\u0026rsquo; case study on why they moved away from Wordpress to the JAMStack. Read here. These are just a few examples of the many websites and applications that are built using the JAMStack architecture. As more businesses and organizations adopt this modern web development approach, we can expect to see even more innovative and powerful web applications built on this platform.\nBusiness benefits of using the JAMStack # The JAMStack approach for website building offers several other benefits for websites beyond improved performance and SEO. Here are some additional benefits:\nLower hosting costs: Since JAMStack sites are static, they can be served from a CDN, which can significantly lower hosting costs. By serving content from a CDN, there is no need for expensive web hosting infrastructure or server-side computing resources. This can result in significant cost savings, particularly for websites with high traffic volume. Easier maintenance: JAMStack sites are easier to maintain than traditional server-generated sites. Since JAMStack sites are pre-built, there is no need for complex server-side rendering or database management. This makes it easier to update and maintain websites, which can save time and resources. Better scalability: JAMStack sites are highly scalable, which makes them ideal for websites that need to handle high traffic volumes or sudden spikes in traffic. Since JAMStack sites are pre-built and served from a CDN, they can handle high traffic volumes without the need for expensive server infrastructure or complex load balancing strategies. Improved developer productivity: JAMStack sites are built using modern web development tools like React and Vue.js, which can improve developer productivity. By leveraging the latest web development tools and techniques, developers can build websites more efficiently, reducing development time and costs. Conclusion # To summarize, JAMStack does the following:\nSites running on webservers TO Sites delivered via global CDNs Webpages rendered at runtime (time consuming) TO Pre-rendered pages served at request (blazingly fast) Monolithic applications TO APIs and Microservices (zero maintenance via third party tools) I strongly believe that the speed and flexibility of the JAMStack is going to bring excellent results immediately. In a world plagued with digital noise and low attention span, if you\u0026rsquo;re not presenting fast enough, you are bound to lose. With several benefits beyond improved performance and SEO, including lower hosting costs, easier maintenance, better scalability, improved developer productivity, and improved user experience, JAMStack is in a great position today to become a fantastic alternative to CMS like Wordpress and Sitecore.\nTake the next step # As I mentioned at the top, this website uses Hugo and it took me a couple of days to set it up - I think two days is not bad for someone who has no professional programming background. I intend to make a detailed step-by-step guide on getting started with the JAMStack and building a website with Hugo (soon) and Gatsby (sometime in the future). So keep an eye out for that coming soon!\n","date":"5 May 2023","permalink":"/blog/jamstack-why-should-digital-marketers-care/","section":"Blogs","summary":"The JAMStack is a modern architecture for building websites and web apps and offers several benefits like including faster page load times, improved security, and better search engine optimization (SEO).

Email marketing ROI is a measure of the revenue generated by your email campaigns compared to the costs associated with creating and executing those campaigns.\nEssentially, it\u0026rsquo;s a metric that helps you determine whether your email marketing efforts are delivering the results you need.\nBut how do you calculate email marketing ROI? There are a few different ways to approach it, but one common formula is:\n(Revenue - Cost of Campaign) / Cost of Campaign x 100 = ROI For example, if you spent $500 on an email campaign and generated $1,000 in revenue from that campaign, your ROI would be:\n($1,000 - $500) / $500 x 100 = 100% So for every dollar you spent on the campaign, you earned two dollars in revenue, resulting in a 100% ROI.\nNow that we know what email marketing ROI is and how to calculate it, let\u0026rsquo;s talk about why it\u0026rsquo;s so important. Simply put, tracking your email marketing ROI is essential for making informed decisions about your marketing strategy. By analyzing your ROI, you can determine which campaigns are most effective and which ones need improvement.\nThis allows you to allocate your marketing budget more effectively, focusing on campaigns that are generating the highest ROI and cutting back on those that aren\u0026rsquo;t.\nBut ROI isn\u0026rsquo;t just about cutting costs and maximizing profits. It can also help you identify areas for growth and optimization.\nFor example, if you notice that a particular campaign is generating a high ROI, you can look for ways to scale that campaign and increase its impact. On the other hand, if a campaign is under performing, you can experiment with different strategies and tactics to see if you can improve its ROI.\nUltimately, email marketing ROI is a powerful tool for any marketer looking to drive revenue and grow their business. By tracking your ROI and using it to inform your marketing decisions, you can optimize your campaigns for maximum impact and achieve better results than ever before.\nWhat about B2B? # Although this is pretty straight forward for eCommerce or subscription-based products, it gets quite complicated when we\u0026rsquo;re thinking about this for B2B. So, factor in conversions on the website, and use your average deal size (even though the buying cycle may be 6 months) to calculate your RoI for each conversion - but keep in mind to see your win/loss ratio and factor that in as well to get a high-level picture.\nOf course, in B2B, once you\u0026rsquo;re in an account, you\u0026rsquo;d probably want to do ABM to penetrate the account, in this article, for B2B, look at this as the first touch email marketing or nurturing.\nSetting Clear Email Marketing Goals # Effective email marketing campaigns all have one thing in common: clear and measurable goals. Before you start crafting your emails, it\u0026rsquo;s essential to identify what you want to achieve.\nAre you looking to drive more website traffic? Boost product sales? Increase customer engagement? Once you\u0026rsquo;ve defined your goals, you can start to create email campaigns that align with those objectives.\nGoals must be SMART - Specific, Measurable, Achieveable, Realistic and Time-bound). Here\u0026rsquo;s a great article from Hubspot on the 5 do\u0026rsquo;s and don\u0026rsquo;ts when making SMART goals.\nIdentifying Your Target Audience # Knowing your audience is crucial when it comes to creating effective email campaigns. Make sure you take the time to segment your email list based on factors such as demographics, interests, and behavior. This will allow you to create more targeted and personalized campaigns that resonate with your subscribers.\nFor example, if you\u0026rsquo;re a clothing retailer, you may want to segment your email list based on gender, age, and purchasing history. This will allow you to send tailored emails that showcase products that are more likely to appeal to specific segments of your audience.\nFor B2B, this can be segmentation either based on their job roles or their seniority. Emails need to connect pain points or objectives of each role to the benefits of what you have to offer.\nDefining Your Key Performance Indicators (KPIs) # Knowing what you\u0026rsquo;re trying to achieve with your email campaigns is just the first step. Next, you need to define the key performance indicators (KPIs) you\u0026rsquo;ll use to measure success.\nCommon email marketing KPIs include open rates (yes, it\u0026rsquo;s back in 2023!), click-through rates (CTRs), and conversion rates. By tracking these metrics, you can determine what\u0026rsquo;s working and what\u0026rsquo;s not and adjust your strategy accordingly.\nFor instance, if you\u0026rsquo;re looking to increase website traffic, you may want to focus on improving your click-through rates.\nIt\u0026rsquo;s also important to note that KPIs can vary depending on your goals. If you\u0026rsquo;re looking to increase customer engagement, you may want to focus on metrics such as clicks, unsubscribe rate and tie it in to your web traffic if that\u0026rsquo;s where you\u0026rsquo;re taking them.\nCreating Compelling Email Content # Your email content is the backbone of your campaigns, so it\u0026rsquo;s important to get it right. Here are 3 tips for creating high-quality email content:\nWriting Compelling Subject Lines # Your subject line is the first thing your subscribers will see, so it needs to grab their attention. Keep it short and sweet, and make sure it clearly communicates the value of your email.\nOne way to make your subject line more compelling is to use personalization. For example, instead of a generic subject line like \u0026ldquo;New Products Available Now,\u0026rdquo; you could use \u0026ldquo;John, Check Out Our Latest Products Just for You.\u0026rdquo; This personal touch can make your subscribers feel valued and increase the likelihood that they\u0026rsquo;ll open your email.\nAnother way to make your subject line stand out is to use humor or curiosity. For example, a subject line like \u0026ldquo;You Won\u0026rsquo;t Believe What We\u0026rsquo;re Giving Away This Month\u0026rdquo; can pique your subscribers\u0026rsquo; interest and encourage them to open your email.\nOptimization can involve testing different formats, lengths, wording, and other factors that may impact the recipient\u0026rsquo;s decision to engage with your email. The ultimate goal is to create subject lines that are engaging, relevant, and attention-grabbing, while accurately representing the content of the email. I asked ChatGPT for some examples of great compelling subject lines:\nLast chance to save 20% on your favorite products The top 10 trends shaping the future of your industry See the results: How we helped XYZ company increase sales by 30% Personalizing Your Email Messages # Personalization is a powerful tool for increasing engagement and conversions. Readers love to see things that tie to their preferences or likes at that point.\nIf you\u0026rsquo;re in eCommerce, consider including personalized product recommendations based on your subscribers\u0026rsquo; past purchases or browsing history. You can also include exclusive discounts or promotions to incentivize purchases.\nFor B2B especially, personalization is the key to make or break positive perception. Send your recipient content based on their last interaction with you like sending them related content based on what they were looking for on your website, and the stage of the funnel they are in; the latter being very important to consider.\nSegmenting your email list based on demographics, behavior, interests or job role can also help you send more targeted messages. For example, if you sell both men\u0026rsquo;s and women\u0026rsquo;s clothing, you could segment your list based on gender and send different emails to each group with products and promotions that are more relevant to them.\nThink of how much you can segment your audience and how deep you can personalize content. This needs planning and content development and is time consuming, so keep that in mind.\nIncluding Strong Calls-to-Action (CTAs) # Your emails should have a clear and compelling call-to-action (CTA) that encourages subscribers to take action. Whether it\u0026rsquo;s visiting your website, making a purchase, or downloading a resource, your CTA should be prominently displayed and easy to follow.\nOne way to make your CTA more effective is to use urgency. For example, you could use phrases like \u0026ldquo;Limited Time Offer\u0026rdquo; or \u0026ldquo;Act Now\u0026rdquo; to create a sense of urgency and encourage subscribers to take action before it\u0026rsquo;s too late in times when you want them to take urgent action.\nAnother way to make your CTA more compelling is to offer an incentive. For example, you could offer a discount code or a free resource in exchange for completing a certain action, like making a purchase or signing up for your newsletter.\nB2B emailing is usually not as dramatic as eCommerce, unless you\u0026rsquo;re selling your SaaS subscription on Black Friday. Even so, CTAs need to be extremely clear like, \u0026ldquo;Watch webinar on-demand.\u0026rdquo;\nFinally, make sure your CTA is prominently displayed and easy to follow. Use clear and concise language, and make sure the button or link is easy to click on both desktop and mobile devices.\nEnsure your emails are mobile-friendly # In 2023, I don\u0026rsquo;t really think this needs an explanation. 81% of all emails are being opened on a mobile device source, and most emailing systems are optimized for mobile.\nKeep the design simple, use minimal images with smaller sizes for faster load on mobile, and make sure the buttons or clicks are optimized for a touch screen.\nTesting and Optimizing Your Email Campaigns # Finally, it\u0026rsquo;s important to test and optimize your email campaigns to ensure you\u0026rsquo;re achieving your goals. A/B testing can be a useful tool for determining what works best for your audience.\nTry testing different subject lines, email layouts, and calls to action to see what resonates best with your subscribers. You can also use data from your KPIs to make informed decisions about how to improve your campaigns.\nWhen it comes to A/B testing, one thing to keep in mind is always make one change in the B version. Since this is an interative process, by doing this in very small increments, it is easy to track what changes are leading to improved performance. Here\u0026rsquo;s an excellent article from Neil Patel\u0026rsquo;s website on A/B testing.\nBy following these steps and continuously refining your email marketing strategy, you can create effective campaigns that drive results and help you achieve your business goals.\nOptimizing Email Deliverability # If the email marketing infrastructure has been setup and warmed up properly, this area shouldn\u0026rsquo;t be a problem. However, not everyone understands how email marketing systems work, and it is crucial to understand this to nail deliveries to inboxes. Your email campaigns won\u0026rsquo;t be effective if they don\u0026rsquo;t reach your subscribers\u0026rsquo; inboxes. So, it is important to know this.\nHere are a few tips for ensuring optimal email deliverability:\nEnsure your contact lists are clean # Ask if you know every contact on your list. More importantly, do they know you? Have they have given you explicit permission to email them? These questions matter because if they\u0026rsquo;re not expecting an email from you, they will either delete your email or send it to spam. The latter being the most dangerous thing to happen to your emailing infrastructure.\nUnderstand what causes poor email deliverability # In short, factors like bounce rate, delivery rate, unsubscribes, inbox placement rate and spam complaints are critical metrics to be tracking if you want to keep your email delivery healthy. I understand most common emailing systems like MailChimp may not have the inbox placement rate metric available, and if you have a system that displays this metric, please track it.\nAvoid spamming # This is straight forward. Please stop sending emails everyday or in regular intervals to your contacts, especially if your emails are adding no value. People get annoyed by pushy behaviour and this is true for emails too. When someone seems too many notifications or emails from you all the time in their inbox, especially their work inbox, they are going to unsubscribe to your emails - and you\u0026rsquo;ve lost a potential customer/deal.\nYour emailing frequency should depend on the industry you\u0026rsquo;re in. Subscribe to your competition and see how frequently they\u0026rsquo;re emailing you. If you want to get a broader perspective, subscribe to companies that offer services to companies like yours, like say, Adobe or Salesforce.\nEnsure your email is authenticated # This is a technical area and requires some understanding to know how emailing systems work. Say you sign up for an account on MailChimp. When you send an email to someone from MailChimp, the recipient of your email will see that you\u0026rsquo;re sending the email, however the sender is not authenticated to send as you. What this means is that someone else could be using your name to send an email to your contact. At this point, your recipient may just delete the email. In fact, some security systems are designed to send such emails directly to the spam folder or not send them at all. Here\u0026rsquo;s a great guide to get started.\nSee engagement # You\u0026rsquo;re sending emails, and they\u0026rsquo;re landing in your recipient\u0026rsquo;s inboxes and you\u0026rsquo;re happy to see good open rates. But what about engagement? What is the CTR% (Click-through rates) on your email? Do you accept responses to your emails? Some emailing systems now look at engagement as an important metric to decide if emails from you are relevant to the users of their service.\nFor example, if your recipient\u0026rsquo;s business uses Microsoft 365, then Microsoft\u0026rsquo;s algorithms determine if your email is relevant to your recipient based on their engagement with your previous emails. If they\u0026rsquo;ve never engaged with your emails, they may end up in the spam folder in the future. You can fix this by desining content that will make them want to engage with your emails.\nChoosing the Right Email Service Provider (ESP) # Make sure you\u0026rsquo;re using a reputable ESP that prioritizes deliverability. Look for features like a high sender reputation, advanced email authentication, and spam analysis.\nIt\u0026rsquo;s also important to choose an ESP that aligns with your email marketing goals and budget. Some ESPs offer advanced features like marketing automation and segmentation, while others may be more budget-friendly for smaller businesses.\nDo your research and read reviews before committing to an ESP to ensure that you\u0026rsquo;re making the right choice for your business. Here\u0026rsquo;s a great article on the best email marketing services to get started.\nTrack your email and IP reputation # Mailbox providers give scores to senders based on how well their emails are received and engaged with. These scores are on both your sending email address and your sending IP. If your scores are high, they are sent to the priority inbox. If they\u0026rsquo;re average, they may be sent to the \u0026ldquo;others\u0026rdquo; inbox. If they are poor, they will be sent to spam or blocked entirely.\nGoogle Postmaster Tools is good to track your scores if you intend to send to gmail or emails that use the Google business infrastructure.\nMicrosft Smart Network Data Service is good to track scores when you\u0026rsquo;re sending to Outlook addresses and also Microsoft 365 business emails.)\nMXToolbox has fantastic tools to check the overall health of your emailing infrastructure. Talos Intelligence from Cisco is a great tool to check IP reputation.\nAnalyzing and Testing Your Email Campaigns # Finally, it\u0026rsquo;s essential to analyze and test your email campaigns regularly. This will enable you to identify areas where you can improve your performance and optimize for better results. Here are a few key steps:\nA/B Testing for Email Optimization: A/B testing involves sending two different versions of your email campaign to a small group of subscribers and then tracking which version performs better. Use this technique to test various elements of your campaign, such as subject lines, CTAs, and email content. Tracking and Analyzing Email Metrics:Use your ESP\u0026rsquo;s analytics dashboard to track and analyze your email metrics regularly. Look for trends and patterns, and use this information to adjust your campaigns for better performance over time. Adjusting Your Strategy Based on Results: When you\u0026rsquo;ve completed your analysis, use the insights gathered to adjust your email marketing strategy. Make data-driven decisions to improve your email campaigns and maximize your ROI. In conclusion # Maximizing your email marketing ROI requires a multifaceted approach that involves clear goal setting, quality content creation, optimal deliverability, and regular analysis and testing. By following the tips outlined in this article, you\u0026rsquo;ll be well on your way to creating effective email campaigns that drive results and deliver a strong ROI for your business.\n","date":"26 April 2023","permalink":"/blog/maximizing-email-marketing/","section":"Blogs","summary":"Not all email marketing campaigns are created equal, and without a focused approach, you may not see the return on investment (ROI) you\u0026rsquo;re aiming for.","title":"Maximizing Email Marketing RoI"},{"content":"If you’re just getting started in Digital Marketing, there are certain factors that can make or break your performance. Things that can aid you in avoiding typical problems and errors, and then there are things that can give you a competitive advantage.\nThe pool of eligible candidates for digital marketing is only growing every day. You’re competing for a client or a job not just locally, but internationally!\nSo are you equipped with the right skills?\nThere are many resources available to help learn the basics of digital marketing and even the advanced stuff.\nHowever, there are some things to know about professional life in digital marketing that can only be self-taught or learned through experience. And I wish someone told me about this when I was getting started a decade ago.\nBut for the most part, these skills can be self-taught.\nWhat I’m talking about are skills and a particular mindset that you can only acquire when you realize their importance. I came to understand that I needed them later in my career after reading or watching Avinash Kaushik, Guy Kawasaki, Julius Fedorovicius, Julian Juenemann, and other marketing gurus.\nThese are not cheats or secrets; rather, they are realities of this career path that you must be aware of and be ready for.\n1. Pick a specialization # When starting off, being a generalist in digital marketing is great to gain a broad understanding of the different areas in digital marketing. If you’ve found an area that you are most interested in, now is the time to build expertise.\nEntry level jobs are a crowded job market, and having a specialization such as an “SEO Specialist,” can lead to higher-paying jobs, career growth and more opportunities. But importantly, you are able to complete tasks efficiently and effectively. Over time, you are able to apply your creative thinking to this area while you’re learning more.\nIn fact, this can give you a clear direction for your career path and you can set specific goals and work towards them.\nDon’t worry — as you gain experience, you will have to dip your feet in other areas of digital marketing anyway, and you will see it all come together rather nicely.\n2. Know your industry # While we’re all focused on the subject matter and techniques of digital marketing, a little known fact is that knowing the industry in which we’re working in is as crucial as knowing digital marketing itself.\nSay you’re a digital marketer for a company in the automobile industry, you must understand what they do, how they’re placed in their industry, who their typical customers are, what are their pain points, how they think, who is the competition, and more.\nBy observing and learning all this, you can craft a strategy or build content that resonates with them. Read or watch content from that industry — news, blogs, videos, car reviews and so on. All these drops make an ocean.\nI can’t stress enough about this point. Knowledge about an industry is 50% of marketing already done. This intelligence can really help craft amazing marketing campaigns.\n3. Be creative inside and analytical outside # Digital marketing is both an art and a science.\nBut how do you explain the science of marketing to the people who know nothing about marketing?\nYou’ve put a CTA in quadrant 4 of an image, but they want you to put it somewhere else simply because they like how it looks. How do tell them this is not how it works?\nFor non-marketers, the creativity backed by science you put into building something, might look like abstract creativity to them. This is where a data-driven, analytical approach comes into play. You should use publicly available data or studies to back your reasoning.\nEven if you’re not doing this, always look at your data and optimize your campaigns.\n4. Share insights, not metrics # This ties in to the previous point I made above. Most analytics tools have advanced visualization systems which are typically helpful in web or app tracking.\nWhat do you do with all the metrics or data you’re looking at? It is important to develop the skill of sharing insights when looking at this data.\nInsights like, “posting a blog post every week should increase traffic to the website by x% and increase lead generation by y%,” are actionable and is of great value even if you’re not presenting this to someone. But you now know it so you can action on it.\nThe Google Analytics 4 course from Analytics Mania is a fantastic course that touches upon this exact topic, and is a highly rated course on learning how to draw insights from data.\n5. Know how CRMs work # Most digital marketing courses don’t really touch upon a Customer Relationship Management Software (CRM). I don’t know why.. maybe it is seen as a platform that only sales people would use.\nBut knowing what a CRM is, how it is used, what it can do and how marketing ties into it is very important if you’re just getting started in digital marketing.\nCRMs also come with integrated marketing automation systems that are natively part of most CRMs. Through a tracking code, CRMs help capture visitor data, track their activities and score them when certain events are positive. This can be a great addition to other analytics tools.\nAs the score of the contact increases, they are pushed to the sales team. This is a typical process in most companies and digital marketing freshers generally have no clue.\nSo my advice would be to start learning CRMs like Hubspot or Zoho. Here’s a list of free CRMs that you could look at and play.\n6. Understand the importance of customer experience # A happy customer is going to be a loyal customer and that is great news for any company. Think about the last time something made you happy and how you felt about a brand or a product.\nA customer or a prospect is likely to have many touchpoints, not necessarily in a linear fashion, and these touchpoints are going to shape their perception of your company. It is important to know what will make them happy or satisfied at that moment.\nHere’s a great article from Hubspot on customer experience.\n7. Disrupt your own work and bring new value to the table # Digital marketers should stay up-to-date with the latest trends and technologies in the industry. They can experiment with emerging technologies like AI, chatbots, or virtual reality to enhance the customer experience and create new marketing opportunities.\nBut this is just the base camp to Mount Everest.\n2023 is the year of the AI and people have already started using models like GPT, Stable Diffusion and more, to create brilliant stuff.\nAutoGPT is the latest jump in the AI curve that makes bots running on GPT fully autonomous. Think of Terminator. They will only stop when you stop them or until they’ve completed their task.\nImagine what AutoGPT will do if you ask it to build a plan and write the sequence of emails with the goal of converting a prospect to a customer.\nLike AI, there are emerging technologies that digital marketers must understand and use. The metaverse was a rage in 2022, although talk around it has died down, it is still a fantastic way to boost engagement.\nWeb3 and Blockchain are going to transform marketing in a few years with higher emphasis on personalization.\nApart from technology, disruption is about breaking the status quo, thinking outside the box and finding different ways to reach the same destination.\n8. Stay up-to-date with privacy laws and regulations # Digital marketers need to be aware of the various privacy laws and regulations that govern online activities, such as GDPR, CCPA, and CASL.\nI personally struggled in this area since I never really bothered to read news about this topic, until I had to ensure a client’s website was fully GDPR compliant. And I realized how implementing is different from just knowing about GDPR.\nUnderstanding these regulations and incorporating them into your marketing strategy can help you avoid legal issues and maintain customer trust.\nI always make it a point to read news around data privacy. When your company needs to change something depending on the country’s privacy law, you’re the go-to expert.\nIt is best to set an alert for this topic on Google Trends so you know if something big has dropped.\n9. Emphasize the importance of testing # Digital marketing requires constant experimentation and testing to optimize performance. You need to be able to test different variables and measure the effectiveness of your campaigns to continuously improve your results.\nThere are experts in test marketing who are able to test the market-fit or viability of a new product or campaign before they launch it on a large scale. This can also be beta testing, offering incentives for early signups, building that FOMO thing and so on, which is great to find some early adopters and learning more.\nWhile most people may not have this level of decision making in the early days of their career, this concept can be applied to other stuff and to go beyond regular A/B testing.\nIn conclusion # It is possible to lose ourselves in the subject matter of various aspects of digital marketing, tackling challenges and pursuing opportunities. I hope this article was able to shed some light on the other aspects of life in digital marketing.\nThese are some of the things that you will need in your career. These are not easy or simple things, but they are essential things that can make a difference in your success as a digital marketer.\nThanks for reading!\n","date":"18 April 2023","permalink":"/blog/9-things-digital-marketing-career/","section":"Blogs","summary":"If you’re just getting started in Digital Marketing, there are certain factors that can make or break your performance.
